"# Recursive-Backtracking-Sudoku" 

Contains a Sudoku class that uses recursive backtracking to find a solution to the puzzle. 
Not very efficient but it will find a solution.

The SudokuBuilder class randomly inputs a few numbers into a grid, solves it and then removes a number of cells that is determined by a method's arguemnts. After this the grid can be called and used however.
